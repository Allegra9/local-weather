LONDON WEATHER real-time
This is a modified version of FreeCodeCamp's "Show the Local Weather" project, but since the "get geolocation" and APIs didn't work properly, I chose to do my city, so that people from all over the world can check "IS  IT RAINING AGAIN?", just kidding, I love the rain.
Background image changes according to the weather type.
You can toggle between temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit, as well as wind speed in m/s or mph.
